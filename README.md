This is my solution for the Backend Take Home Test I received from Fetch Rewards.

This project was developed and tested using the Spring Tool Suite (STS) IDE.

# Steps to configure environment
* Ensure that the latest version of Oracle JDK is installed on the machine
* Eclipse IDE (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
* Install Eclipse
* Spring Tool Suite (https://spring.io/tools)
* Install Spring Tool Suite

# Checking out the code inside Spring Tool Suite
* File > Import > Git > Projects from Git > 
* Clone URI > https://github.com/pelicanfeet/BackendCodingExercise.git
* Important: Ensure the 3rd option is checked on the final screen to "Import as General Project"

# Running the application
* Right click on the project folder in the Package Explorer window on the left, and choose "Run As > Spring Boot App"
* Then, open up a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
* You will be brought to the home page and can interact with the application from there
